# Welcome to kilobots_caterpillarAuto

kilobots_caterpillarAuto is a PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) inspired automatic caterpillar chain based on Kilobots. The final result is that a chain of Kilobots move automatically like a caterpillar.

This work is done by the OPAL Laboratory, SUSTech, China. And a wiki is accessible for this project.


## Get started

1. Set the "kilo_uid" of one specific Kilobot to be 0 through the Kilobots Toolkit "kilogui". 

2. Put it at the faremost tail of the Kilobots caterpillar. We can call this specific Kilobot the "SEED".

3. Pysically put all the other Kilobots in front one by one to form a chain.

4. Upload the file "caterpillarAuto.hex" in the build file to all the Kilobots through the Kilobots Toolkit "kilogui". 

5. Send the "Run" command to Kilobots through the Kilobots Toolkit "kilogui".

## Note:
The Kilobots Toolkit "kilogui" can be downloaded at https://www.kilobotics.com/download.
